# Data Transformation in JavaScript

Experimenting with data transformation libraries in JavaScript.

## Description

Working with data in JavaScript requires the ability to transform and reshape the dataset, especially when desiging interactive data apps with tables and visualizations.

Within this repository you'll find JavaScript and HTML files where I experiment with the following libraries: Danfo.js, tidy.js, and Arquero. My goal is to find a library I identify with for pairing with other libraries to build data apps.

Because my use case will often be to transform data in the conjunction with D3.js for visualizations, my general approach is to read in the dataset with D3, transform with a library from the above, and then visualize.

## Update 4/26/23

After experimentation, I've loved the Arquero library which features a syntax and structure similar to what I've come to enjoy from {dplyr} and {tidyr} packages in R. This is likely to be my go to transformation library.
